# _Find & Replace_

_Sept, 23 2020_

#### _An application that finds a given word and replaces it with a different given word_

#### By _**Vanessa Stewart & Donny Mays**_

## Description

_This is a project for Epicodus to practice using Ruby classes, and methods (including document reading) with test driven developement. The original instructions include:_

Create a script where a user can find and replace words in a string. The method in action will look something like "Hello world".find_and_replace("world", "universe"). The result of would be "Hello universe".

Do first: Write the method so that it replaces whole words only, as in the "hello world" example above. Make sure all your tests pass.

Do second: Add to your method so that your method takes into account partial matches. For example "I am walking my cat to the cathedral".find_and_replace("cat", "dog") would return the silly phrase "I am walking my dog to the doghedral."

Extra credit: Refactor your application so that it works with a .txt file. You can use Rubyâ€™s File.open() method to open a file and then perform operations on it.

Make sure to account for odd user inputs like all capitalization, partial capitalization, etc. Include a README for this project and create a Git repository for it.

## Specifications
| Spec     | Behavior | Input    | Output   |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1 | It will successfully find and replace words in a string | "Hello world".find_and_replace("world", "universe") | "Hello universe"  |
| 2 | Program successfully deals with partial matches. | "I am walking my cat to the cathedral".find_and_replace("cat", "dog") | "I am walking my dog to the doghedral." |
| 3 |  Program works with a .txt file and File.open() method to open a file and perform the find and replace method on it.| file.open(document.txt), variable = file.read, variable.find_and_replace("word1", "word2"), file.close | Replaces all word1's in the document with word2. |
